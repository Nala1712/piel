Physical Experimental Relationships
===================================

In order to understand the relationship of simulation modelling techniques to the physical reality, it is also important to have some appreciation of how to set up an actual experiment for determining some common functionality of real devices.

We will explore implementations in a very generic form with some examples, however experimental reality can be disgusting and a source of multiple frustrations that can traumatise and nauseate you for a long time. Be wary when entering the lab and hopefully get lucky.
