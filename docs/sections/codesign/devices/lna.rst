Ultra-Wideband LNAs
--------------------

Let's understand types of ultra-wideband LNAs. Ultra-wideband systems have been continuously developed for high-speed wireless communications capable of transmitting over a wide frequency band at low powers, including the 2.4 GHz and 5.2/5.7 GHz 802.11b/g/a IEEE standards [1, 2].

Broadband input matching can be obtained by employing a common-gate at the input-stage of a two-stage common-gate & common-source LNA configuration [1]. This type of architecture, compared to other broadband techniques, can demonstrate less design complexity, low high-frequency noise, relatively low power dissipation, and a comparatively small size.

Distributed amplifiers, common-ground amplifiers, noise-cancellation, resistive-feedback are a number of commonly-used wideband architectures.

Distributed wideband amplifiers have increased power consumption as observed by [3] compared to common-ground common-source wideband LNAs in [1].

Inductive source-degeneration is a narrowband input matching technique achieving target gate real impedance by canceling the imaginary impedance from a gate inductor with an accurately designed source inductor at a resonant frequency [4]. Since this is a pure reactive impedance, no resistive thermal noise is added to the LNA since this is a purely reactive real impedance. An improved narrowband matching technique is using an LC-network using the parasitic RF input-resistance of the MOSFET to achieve improved input matching without degrading the noise figure (NF) and increasing DC-power consumption [5].

A review on inductive-series peaking, feedback low-noise amplifier design is presented in [6] to achieve wideband 50 Ω input matching through an active-load & resistive-feedback current-reuse circuit design. However, this type of architecture can suffer from instability risks from input bondwire inductance [7]. There is a design tradeoff between noise and gain requirements that increase design complexity. For cryogenic applications, a suitable tradeoff to minimize power consumption may be targeted. This type of architecture has shown high gain with low power consumption and low noise figures [8, 9].

Another wideband input matching, noise-figure reduction technique is using a simultaneous "electronic feedforward" technique. This uses a parallel input voltage-sensing amplifier to cancel the input-impedance stage noise with the output signal combination network [10, 11].

Another method to achieve wideband input matching is to design a multi-section band-pass filter LC network that resonates with the target wideband [2]. This can achieve low power consumption and can suppress high-frequency noise-figure increases, but requires a large number of accurate inductors with a large footprint as observed in Table 1.
