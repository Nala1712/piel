# # Digital Simulation & Layout Design Space Exploration

# ### Deployment and Timing of Large-Scale `openlane 2`
#
# One common and powerful aspect of this tool is the large-scale deployment of `openlane 2` designs so you can explore, say, the effect of different variations on your digital designs. You might want to multi-thread running your designs. Let's explore how to do this.
#
# We will use the built-in `multiprocessing` module in `python`:

import multiprocessing
import time
import piel

# We will go through the whole process of using `amaranth` for digital simulation and design later. For now, let's assume we have a random truth table we want to implement multiple times with different `id`. We will time both sequential and parallel implementations of this layout flow, and determine which is faster.
