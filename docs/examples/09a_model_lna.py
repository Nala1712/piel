# # Low-Noise Amplifier Design Principles

# In this example, we will understand the design, modelling and performance requirements of a low-noise amplifier. We will specifically explore ultra-wideband ~180nm CMOS designs as these are more reproducible with open-source toolsets.
#
# We will first understand performance parameters of a set of ultra-wideband designs before using this as reference to model a similar design using open-source technology and `piel`.
